Build a small school system where you define and manipulate Student and Employee data using OOP

Classes & Structs
1. Person (base class)
Properties: Name, Age

Override ToString, Equals, GetHashCode, GetType

Abstract method GetRoleDescription()

2. Student (inherits from Person)
Properties: int Grade,  Marks

Constructor: accepts name, optional age, optional grade = 1

Method: AddMarks(params int[] marks)

Overload:

+ operator to combine marks of two students.

== and != by comparing Name and Grade

3. Employee (struct)
Properties: int ID, decimal Salary

Overload ==, !=, <, > based on Salary

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement all classes and structs as described.

Demonstrate:

Overridden System.Object methods

Operator overloading for both class and struct

Use of is, as, and named parameters in method calls

Create a simple console app that:

Creates and manipulates a few Student and Employee instances

Prints all info clearly
